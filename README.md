# CraftingCombinatorLocale
Translations for the Crafting Combinator mod.

This mod serves the purpose of translating the "virtual recipes" from other mods. It shouldn't be needed for vanilla recipes since those are to be in the main mod.

#Translation conventions#
If you contribute to these translations, please follow these rules:

- Translation for each mod should be in a single file named the same as the mod in the appropriate language folder
- All the files should start with `[virtual-signal-name]`
- Would be nice but not needed to sort the lines in the order they appear in the menu

#Currently translated mods#
I'm going to keep this list updated with the mods that are already translated for easier reference.<br>
Note that the translations listed here may not be complete.
